## 1. Qualitative Information on the First Half Consolidated Results 

Upon the adoption of IFRS, the Ajinomoto Group has introduced "business profit” as a new profit level that will 

better enable investors, the Board of Directors, and the Management Committee to grasp the core business 

results and future outlook of each business while also facilitating continual evaluation of the Group’s business 

portfolio by the Board of Directors and the Management Committee. “Business profit” is defined as sales and 

share of profit of associates and joint ventures minus cost of sales, selling expenses, research and 

development expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Business profit does not include other 

operating income or other operating expenses. 

In addition, in the first half ended September 30, 2024, the Company finalized the provisional accounting 

treatment for a business combination and a significant revision to the initial allocation of acquisition costs has 

been made and reflected in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 

(1) Overview of Operating Results 

In the first half ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s consolidated sales increased 8.2% year on year, 

or ¥56.2 billion, to ¥744.2 billion. This was due to increases in sales in the Seasonings and Foods segment, 

the Frozen Foods segment, and the Healthcare and Others segment, including the effect of currency 

translation. Business profit increased 13.5% year on year, or ¥10.3 billion, to ¥86.9 billion primarily due to the 

increases in sales in the Seasonings and Foods segment and the Healthcare and Others segment and other 

factors. Profit attributable to owners of the parent company totaled ¥50.2 billion, up 8.1% year on year, or ¥3.7 

billion, primarily as a result of higher business profit. 

Furthermore, the Company has revised the full-year consolidated performance forecast for the fiscal year 

ending March 31, 2025 announced on May 9, 2024 in light of recent trends in business performance and 

other factors. 

As a result of reviewing the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the state of the economy, the sales 

situation, and other factors under the current business environment, the Company has upwardly revised the 

forecast for sales in the Healthcare and Others segment by ¥5.5 billion from the previous forecast, reflecting 

strong sales of Functional Materials (electronic materials and others), and the overall forecast for sales to 

¥1,532.5 billion. The progress rate of sales against the revised forecast is 48.6%. As a result of reviewing the 

current business environment, including the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and economic conditions, 

the sales situation, and the status of company-wide initiatives, the forecast for business profit in the 

Seasonings and Foods segment has been revised downward by ¥2.9 billion from the previous forecast, 

mainly to reflect the impact of higher coffee bean prices, and the forecast for business profit in the Healthcare 

and Others segment has been revised upward by ¥5.2 billion from the previous forecast, mainly to reflect the 

effect of higher sales in the Functional Materials (electronic materials and others) segment. As a result, the 

Company has raised its total business profit forecast by ¥2.0 billion from the previous forecast to ¥160.0 

billion. The progress rate of business profit against the revised forecast is 54.3%. The forecast for profit 

attributable to owners of the parent company is unchanged despite the upward revision of the forecast for 

business profit, mainly reflecting expenses associated with structural reforms. The progress rate of profit 

attributable to owners of the parent company against the full-year forecast is 52.9%. The forecast is based on 

an exchange rate of ¥149 to US$1 (for the second half, a rate of ¥145 to US$1). 

Please also refer to Notice of Revision to Full-Year Consolidated Performance Forecast for the Fiscal Year 

Ending March 31, 2025 released today (November 7, 2024) for more details about the revision of the 

consolidated earnings forecast. 7

effect of currency translation and other factors. Segment business profit decreased 32.2% year on year, 

or ¥2.1 billion, to ¥4.5 billion, mainly because of an increase in strategic expenses despite higher revenue

mainly owing to an increase in sales of electronic materials and Bio-Pharma Services & Ingredients.

revenue for electronic materials and other factors.

profit accompanying large increase in revenue. 

Others: Large increase in profit accompanying increase in revenue. 

(iv) Other 

In the Other segment, sales increased 5.6% year on year, or ¥0.4 billion, to ¥7.6 billion. Segment business 

profit increased 59.7% year on year, or ¥1.0 billion, to ¥2.8 billion. 10 

(2) Overview of Financial Position 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s consolidated total assets stood at ¥1,733.9 billion, a decrease of 

¥34.4 billion from ¥1,768.3 billion at the end of the previous fiscal year on March 31, 2024. The main reasons 

for this were the effect of currency translation in conjunction with the appreciation of the yen and a decrease 

in income taxes receivable due to tax refund, despite an increase in inventories. 

Total liabilities came to ¥900.6 billion, ¥16.7 billion more than the ¥883.9 billion at the end of the previous 

fiscal year. This was mainly due to an increase in interest-bearing debt despite a decrease in trade and other 

payables. Interest-bearing debt totaled ¥538.4 billion, an increase of ¥46.7 billion from the end of the previous 

fiscal year, primarily due to the issuance of bonds. 

Total equity as of September 30, 2024 was ¥833.2 billion, ¥51.1 billion less than the ¥884.4 billion at the 

end of the previous fiscal year. This was mainly due to a decrease in exchange differences on translation of 

foreign operations in conjunction with the appreciation of the yen in addition to a decrease due to the 

purchase of treasury stock. Equity attributable to owners of the parent company, which is total equity minus 

non-controlling interests, totaled ¥770.4 billion, and the equity ratio attributable to owners of the parent 

company was 44.4%. 

(3) Overview of Cash Flows 

The overview of cash flows for the first half ended September 30, 2024 is as follows. 

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled ¥81.7 billion, compared with ¥53.4 billion during the first 

half ended September 30, 2023. The main factors included ¥78.1 billion in profit before income taxes and 

¥42.6 billion in depreciation and amortization, offset by a ¥25.4 billion increase in inventories. 

Net cash used in investing activities came to ¥38.5 billion, compared with ¥34.0 billion during the first half 

ended September 30, 2023. The main factors included ¥47.5 billion in purchase of property, plant and 

equipment, and intangible assets. 

Net cash used in financing activities was ¥36.2 billion, compared with ¥9.1 billion net cash provided by 

financing activities during the first half ended September 30, 2023. The main factors included ¥117.0 billion in 

proceeds from long-term borrowings, ¥87.0 billion decrease in short-term borrowings, and ¥50.0 billion in 

purchase of treasury stock. 

As a result of the foregoing, cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 totaled ¥176.5 billion. 

(4) Analysis of Capital Resources and Liquidity 

(i) Liquidity 

During the first half ended September 30, 2024, the Company ensured adequate short-term liquidity on hand 

through funding methods that mainly consisted of committed credit lines, overdraft facilities, and commercial 

paper issuance facilities. 

Moreover, in addition to maintaining an adequate ratio of liquidity on hand, the Company ensured funding 

security through committed credit lines concluded with its main banks. As of September 30, 2024, the 

unused amount of committed credit lines was ¥170.0 billion in Japanese yen and US$100 million in foreign 

currency. Furthermore, the Company provides an emergency loan facility to respond to temporary cash 

shortages at overseas consolidated subsidiaries with a high possibility of liquidity risks. 

(ii) Fund Procurement 

In the first half ended September 30, 2024, the Company raised funds through borrowings from financial 

institutions and issuances of domestic straight bonds and commercial papers in order to fund its operations 

and to extend the maturity of short-term borrowings related to the full acquisition of Forge Biologics Holdings, 

LLC (“Forge”), taking into consideration the balance between direct and indirect finance from the perspective 

of funding costs and risk diversification, and the balance between long-term and short-term funding. 

(iii) Use of Funds 

During the first half ended September 30, 2024, funds were primarily used to finance business operations 

and to extend short-term borrowings related to the full acquisition of Forge. 11
